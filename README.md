# Pacmen 
## Description:
This is a page that creates Pacmen and make them move. One Pacman should be generated each time, all Pacmen should be traveling in random directions and velocities, and all Pacmen shall 'bounce' when hit the border and start traveling in the opposite direction to simulate the 'bounce' effect.

## How-to:
### Install
Download the code and upzip the folder.
### Run
Lauch index.html
### Play
Click the 'Add Pacman' button to create 1 additional Pacman
Click the 'Start game' button to make the Pacmen move
## Know issue and improvement road maps:
8/24/2022: 
1. clicking "Start game" multiple times would change (increase) the speed of all exsisting and moving Pacmen. Remove that button once the Pacmen has started moving.
2. adding in "Stop game" button.
3. Pacmen 'eating too fast'. Slow down the amination without increasing the intervel of checking collision. Un-coupling the two features.
